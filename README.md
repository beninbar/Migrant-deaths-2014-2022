## Where are they? Migrant deaths
This project aims to bring attention to deaths occurring during or as a result of global migration. While migratory deaths have garnered some press coverage during momentary crises, there has been minimal visualization or long-term focus on this human toll. Here, various visual methods are combined with interactivity to view the scale of the issue geographically by mapping and charting it. The ultimate goal is to implore the viewer to question geopolitical constructs that facilitate this suffering.

Originally inspired by an assignment to utilize Leaflet, I was immediately drawn to the highly reported but poorly understood migrant crisis, starting in Europe in 2014. Although a Google search today might provide maps, statistics, or other visual guides, this has been a recent phenomenon. Despite this, media attention to the various ongoing global migratory crisis "hotspots" remains transitory, contributing to a fragmented perspective. Indeed, digestible and centralized migrant death data, at least in Europe, was [not available until 2013](http://www.themigrantsfiles.com/), with the [UN International Organization for Migration](https://www.iom.int/iom-history) only initiating a public database in 2014.

## Process
The main goal was to immerse the viewer into the graphical experience. The page by itself utilizes a clean, soft dynamic that attempts to mimic the behaviors characteristic of the open ocean: the waveform of graphics entering the page, the horizon-esque dark blue-ish color schemes, the eyes drawn to single points of data or text in a vast space.

The first iteration wireframe provided a structure that was later simplified:
