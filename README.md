## Where are they? Migrant deaths

This project aims to bring attention to deaths occurring during or as a result of global migration. While migratory deaths have garnered some press coverage during momentary crises, there has been minimal visualization or long-term focus on this human toll. Here, various visual methods are combined with interactivity to view the scale of the issue geographically by mapping and charting it. The ultimate goal is to implore the viewer to question geopolitical constructs that facilitate this suffering.
