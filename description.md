Each year, growing numbers of migrants undertake perilous overseas or overland crossings, or both. This map details every migratory death or disappearance from January, 2014 through February, 2022. Each red dot represents a record collected by the [Missing Migrants Project](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/), a project of the [International Organization for Migration (IOM)](https://gmdac.iom.int/map-tracking-migrant-deaths-and-disappearances). Some dots represent just 1 death or disappearance, while others represent many more. Hover or click on each dot, and on the list of years at left to learn more.

This is a continuation of a [previous project](https://beninbar.github.io/Migrant-deaths/migrantdeaths.html).[^1]

[^1]: These [data](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads) were originally inspired by [The Migrant's Files](http://www.themigrantsfiles.com/), an open-source academic enterprise in [data journalism](https://jplusplus.org/en/) which spearheaded the effort to track migrant deaths in 2013. Although the project was suspended in 2016, the IOM took up the mantle and continued this work, which is what is shown on this page.
